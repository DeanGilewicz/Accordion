        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

        <p>I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this! Go on, ask me anything; I'm on fire! When I say run, run. ...RUN! Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. Boring. And I hate hotels. I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part.</p>
